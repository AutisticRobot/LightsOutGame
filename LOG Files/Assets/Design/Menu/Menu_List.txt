Background color - medium gray (#626a77), slightly blue

Buttons in Minion Variable Concept, but other "old school" font would work too. 
I would recommend using a font to make it easier to scale but I did export them to put in there.
- I would recommend adding a box around (simply white, 5px border) when hovering over option, 
START box is 530x155px // OTHER box is 400x140px


Windows (two boxes, the yellow one on top of the other)
- the "lights" can be turned off and on to show progess or even a simple animation by delaying them by a few seconds. 
(I would recommend slow blinking to avoid strobe effect)
-to make them responsive/scalable, the position and size needs to be relative
- I have exported them as a grid for easy use, but really do recommend using the single windows and placing them by hand
-grid could be better to reduce amount of objects, but needs more code to "blink"

Almost everything is boxes, so they could be "re-made" in Gordot for easier scaling (pixels can look a bit weird when scaled to far)
